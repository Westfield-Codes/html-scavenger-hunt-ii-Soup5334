### 10 Scavenger Hunt Questions:
1. What are the **red parts** called?
**tags** 
2. What is true about **ALL** of these red things?
**Every Tag comes before somthing else, every "sentence" starts with a tag**
3. What is true about **MOST** of these things but not all? 
**most of the tags have other types of writting in them like links and attributes**
4. What is true about **TWO** of these -- the links (HREF) and the images (SRC)?
**Something thats true about both of them is that they are inside a tag bracket and feature a external source of some sourt(like a pictur or link).** 
5. What does it mean when one of these things begins with **<!--** ?
**things that begin with <! are comments, after inspecting the my dog website i realized that comments with <! don't have a visual effect on the website and it doesnt look like you can interact with them.**
6. What is the difference between the first and second "My Dog" in the **code**?
**The first my dog is a title while the second my dog is a heading, represented by the <h1> code.**
7. Where do you see the first "My Dog" in the **browser**?
**I see in at the top of the screen above all the other things.**
8. Why is the second "My Dog" **red** in the **browser**?
9. Can you **hide the head section** in the code? 
**Yes by using the hidden attribute.**
10. What do the **indentations** "mean"? 
**I think the indentations connect a line of code to another line of code so they are connected or relevant to eachother in a way.**
